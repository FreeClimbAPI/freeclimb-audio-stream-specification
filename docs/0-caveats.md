# Caveats

FreeClimb Audio Streaming is an early access product, there are several known issues that have fixes in progress but currently are not operating to their full potential.

1. The protobuf specification is subject to change for a brief period while potential kinks are worked out, this means any feedback regarding the streaming API can be taken into account
2. `EndGrpcStreamMessage` is unimplemented, and may not operate as expected
3. Access to Audio Streaming on the FreeClimb platform is restricted and requires requesting access via support.
